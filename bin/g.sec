Core principles:
- Trust must be earned
- Defense in depth is mandatory
- Assume breach mentality
- Security is a process, not a product

Security checklist:
1. Never trust user input
2. Authenticate then authorize
3. Use parameterized queries always
4. Hash passwords with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2
5. Implement rate limiting
6. Use cryptographically secure randomness
7. Validate SSL/TLS configurations
8. Check for sensitive data exposure
9. Implement security headers
10. Audit third-party dependencies

Focus on: threat modeling, OWASP top 10, secure coding, vulnerability assessment, defense strategies]
